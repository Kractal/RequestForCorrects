This document is a printed form of MSC2010, an MSC revision produced jointly by the editorial staffs of Mathematical Reviews (MR) and Zentralblatt f̈ur Mathematik (Zbl) in consultation with the mathematical community. The goals of this revision of the Mathematics Subject Classification (MSC) were set out in the announcement of it and call for comments by the Executive Editor of MR and the Chief Editor of Zbl in August 2006. This document results from the MSC revision process that has been going on since then. MSC2010 will be fully deployed from
July 2010.    
此文档是 MSC2010 的打印版本，每个 MSC 修订由《数学评论》(Mathematical Reviews, MR)和《数学文摘》(Zentralblatt f̈ur Mathematik, Zbl)的编辑咨询数学社区共同制订。此版数学学科分类标准(Mathematics Subject Classification, MSC)修订的目标已经在其公告中载明，并于2006年8月由 MR 的执行编辑和 Zbl 主编请求评论。此文档源于自那时以来一直在进行的 MSC 修订过程。MSC2010 将于2010年7月完整发布。
